    <p>Description</p>
    <p style="max-width: 600px;">I have been drinking te de canela, or cinnamon tea, since I was a kid. My mother always made it for us when we had a sore throat, a fever or just because. This cinnamon tea can be sweetened with honey, sugar, or piloncillo, which is Mexican brown sugar, and we often added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. As adults the tea is spiked with pure cane alcohol, which is very common amongst Hispanic people.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 sticks Ceylon cinnamon, broken into pieces</li>
        <li>Choice of sweetener, such as honey, sugar, or piloncillo (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, or as needed (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Place water and cinnamon sticks in a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain tea and pour into a cup; add sweetener and lemon juice as desired. </li>
    </ol>
