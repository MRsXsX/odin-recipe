    <h1>Mama Teto's Sensation Salad</h1>
    <img src="images/mamas.jpeg">
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Sensation Salad originated decades ago at a now-closed restaurant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and many home cooks have since adopted it as a family recipe. Bright lemon and a kick of garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard define the dressing, and a heavy-handed grating of salty, hard cheese like Parmesan or Pecorino Romano tops it off. My grandmother, Mama Te, often made her version of Sensation Salad for barbeques, serving it with chicken, rice pilaf, and garlic bread. This easy, everyday salad also pairs well with red meat, seafood, and Italian dishes. Top each serving more grated Parmesan if desired.</p>
